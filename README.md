# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to help LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, identify low-risk and high-risk loans using machine learning. I used three different machine learning models to make predictions: logistic regression, balanced random forest classifier and easy ensemble AdaBoost classifier. Since low-risk loans greatly outnumbered high-risk loans in the dataset, I had to resample the data to get an even amount of target values so that the machine learning algorithm would make more accurate predictions.

# Results
As stated above, low-risk loans greatly outnumbered high-risk loans:

So before training the machine learning model, I had to resample the data.

Here are the results from oversampling the data and using logistic regression to make predictions...

## Oversampling

### Random Oversampling

* 66% of the predictions were correct
* On average, precision was very high (99%) but this is misleading because the precision for high-risk and low-risk loans varied greatly (1% and 100% respectivly).
* Average recall was 60%. 72% for high-risk and 60% for low-risk  

### SMOTE Oversampling

* 66% of the predictions were correct
* Once again, average precision was very high at 99% but varied greatly between the high-risk and low-risk
* Average recall was 69%. 62% for high-risk and 69% for low-risk

## Undersampling

Here are the results from undersampling (also using logistic regression for predictions)

### Cluster Centroids

* Accuracy score was slightly lower at 54%
* Average precision was 99%. 1% for high-risk and 99% for low-risk
* Average recall was 40%. 69% for high-risk and 40% for low-risk


## Combination Sampling

Here are the results from combination sampling (oversampling and undersampling) (also using logistic regression for predictions)

### SMOTEENN

* Accuracy score was 63%
* Average precision was 99%. 1% for high-risk and 99% for low-risk
* Average recall was 60%. 65% for high-risk and 60% for low-risk

## Balanced Random Forest Classifier

* Accuracy score was high at 79%
* Average precision was 99%. 3% for high-risk and 99% for low-risk
* Average recall was 87%. 70% for high-risk and 87% for low-risk

## Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier

* Accuracy was very high at 93%
* Average precision was 99%. 9% for high-risk and 99% for low-risk
* Average recall was 94%. 92% for high-risk and 94% for low-risk

# Summary

Overall, all of the models made accurate predictions. Easy ensemble AdaBoost Classifier model was the most accurate with 93% of its predictions being right. Cluster Centrods model had the lowest accuracy score at 54%. All of the models had a very low precision for high-risk loans, which means that most of the loans that were predicted to be high-risk were not actually high-risk. This is not necessarly a bad thing though because falsely classifying a high-risk loan as low-risk can be a costly mistake.
Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier is the best model because it had the highest accuracy score and it did not mispredict too many of the loans that were actually high-risk
